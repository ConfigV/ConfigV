  these groups, respectively.}

Fig.~\ref{fig-example} presents misconfiguration examples in real-world
that we aim to address. All the examples are extracted from
misconfiguration issues reported in real-world efforts%
~\cite{yin11anempirical, configdataset}.
We classify our target configuration errors
into five groups: 1) format error; 2) entry missing error; 3) value type
error; 4) ordering error; and 5) value correlation error.
The five examples in Fig.~\ref{fig-example} correspond to the above five
groups, respectively.
