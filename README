# Testing the tool 

open src/Settings.hs
change trainginTarget = Test 
  this will make the tool learn from the file in testLearn dir
change verificationTarget = "user"
  this will make the tool verify the files in the user dir

Both 'testLearn' and 'user' are preloaded with very simple configurations to test that the tool is working correct. 

# Basic operation

The key files are:

 - src/Settings.hs : all the useful settings to configure the tool
 - cachedRules.json : the rules that were learned in json form, can be manually inspected as a sanity check

#Reproducing results

By editing the Settings.hs file, you can reproduce any experiment from the paper
For example, to generate the error reports from the Github files, with probablistic types and rule graph sorting, change the following settings:

   verificationTarget = "githubFiles"
   trainingTarget = Prob

   sortingStyle  =  RuleGraphDegree
   pROBTYPES = True

## Support and Confidence

If you want to see the effect of different support and confidence thresholds, simply edit the threshold settings in the Setting.hs file.
The values are preset to the values used in the evaluation in the paper.

# Helpful tips

To read cachedRules.json rules easier, run from the command line
   > python -m json.tool ../cachedRules.json
