# Guide to Source code

The Learners directory has a module for each type of error that is learned/checked.
This is the main workhorse, the rest of the code is scaffolding for these modules.
Each module here will implement three core methods for an Attribute (a class of possible errors).


class Foldable t => Attribute t a where
  learn :: IRConfigFile -> t a
    Given one configFile, generate a set of rules

  merge :: t a -> t a -> t a 
    Given two sets of rules, create a single consistent set

  check :: t a -> IRConfigFile -> Maybe (t a)
    Given a set of rules and a file, check for errors
