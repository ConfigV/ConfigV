# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.

# For explanations see

# * InnoDB
#
# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
#
# * InnoDB plugin
# As of MySQL 5.1.38, the InnoDB plugin from Oracle is included in the MySQL source code.
# It has many improvements and better performances than the built-in InnoDB storage engine.
# Please read http://www.innodb.com/products/innodb_plugin/ for more information.
# Uncommenting the two following lines to use the InnoDB plugin.
#ignore_builtin_innodb
#plugin-load=innodb=ha_innodb_plugin.so
innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 500
#innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G

#
# * Multiple plugins
# If you want to load multiple plugins at the same time, you have to put them on a single
# plugin-load line. MySQL does not support several plugin-load directives and always keep the 
# last read. Then if you want, for example, use the Pinba storage engine while having the
# the InnoDB plugin loaded, you should uncomment the following line
#plugin-load=innodb=ha_innodb_plugin.so;libpinba_engine.so
#
# * Security Features
#
# Read the manual, too, if you want chroot!
# chroot = /var/lib/mysql/
#
# For generating SSL certificates I recommend the OpenSSL GUI "tinyca".
#
# ssl-ca=/etc/mysql/cacert.pem
# ssl-cert=/etc/mysql/server-cert.pem
# ssl-key=/etc/mysql/server-key.pem
