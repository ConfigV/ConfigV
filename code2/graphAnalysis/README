# Loading MongoDB Data
  
    mongorestore --dir dump

This will restore the data from our session to a running MongoDB
listening on port 27017 without authentication enabled.

# Reload Data

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python load_data.py

read through the script for the specifics (some stuff is hard-coded)
but you will be able to load a JSON file to a MongoDB instance
running and listening with the correct configuration for MongoClient()
