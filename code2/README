look like interactive-timeout is a bool flag, but interactive_timeout is a value
if this is true, the following is an error

learningSet/MySQL/344d08a8e9776672196aa568d48941dc.cnf:interactive-timeout             = 360


if you use character-set-server, you should also use --collation-server to specify the collation.

actually the type error could be interesting for the regexs
take valid values "utf8" and "latin1" and we want "UTF8" to be invalid.
want to again apply convex hull method for counting tightest regex matchs
we shouldnt enter all these type manually - should be just tightest regex violations

casting is an interesting issue - if a field has type boolean, then it should only take ON or OFF
it can also (and in practice often does) take 0 or 1
what is the right approach here?
