# /etc/my.cfg

# Last updated 2012-09-23 by Teemu Leisti.

# Most of the memory settings are set to be the same as the example setting file
# /usr/share/doc/mysql55-server-5.5.25/my-large.cnf, which is meant for systems
# with 512M of memory.  This server currently has twice that, i.e. 1G of memory,
# which should make these settings safe.
