# This file contains a bunch of settings that will increase the performance of URD using MySQL.
# Merge these in your my.cnf and restart mysql and URDD.

# These settings are for a machine with 2GB memory. If you have less you should limit the amount a bit. I doubt increasing these values will help much.

# Also valuable is mysqltuner. Run:
#   wget mysqltuner.pl
# to get it then run it.
