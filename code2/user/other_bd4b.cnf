# Example MySQL config file for very large systems. 
# 
# This is for a large system with memory of 1G-2G where the system runs mainly 
# MySQL. 
# 
# You can copy this file to 
# /etc/my.cnf to set global options, 
# mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to set server-specific options (in this 
# installation this directory is /usr/local/mysql/data) or 
# ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options. 
# 
# In this file, you can use all long options that a program supports. 
# If you want to know which options a program supports, run the program 
# with the "--help" option. 

# The following options will be passed to all MySQL clients 
[client] 
#password = your_password 
port = 3306 
socket = /tmp/mysql.sock 

# Here follows entries for some specific programs 

# The MySQL server
