#
# * Basic Settings
#

#
# * IMPORTANT
#   If you make changes to these settings and your system uses apparmor, you may
#   also need to also adjust /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld.

# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.

# * Fine Tuning

# * Query Cache Configuration
#
query_cache_limit       = 500k #was 1M
query_cache_size        = 8M #was 16M, lowered for RAM
#
# * Logging and Replication
#
# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.

# Error logging goes to syslog. This is a Debian improvement :)

# Here you can see queries with especially long duration
#log_slow_queries   = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
#long_query_time = 2
#log-queries-not-using-indexes
#
# The following can be used as easy to replay backup logs or for replication.
# note: if you are setting up a replication slave, see README.Debian about
#       other settings you may need to change.

# * BerkeleyDB
#
# Using BerkeleyDB is now discouraged as its support will cease in 5.1.12.

#
# * InnoDB
#
# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
# You might want to disable InnoDB to shrink the mysqld process by circa 100MB.

# * Security Features

# Read the manual, too, if you want chroot!

# For generating SSL certificates I recommend the OpenSSL GUI "tinyca".
