[mysqld]

### General
user                = mysql
port                = 3306
datadir                         = /var/lib/mysql
tmpdir                          = /tmp
socket                          = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
skip-external-locking           = 1
log_error                       = /var/log/mysqld.log

## This prevents using host-based authentication. That means users must be
## created using an ip-address (ie 'myuser'@'192.168.100.1') or must make
## use of the % wildcard (ie 'myuser'@'%'). The benefit to not using
## host-based authentication is that DNS will not impact MySQL performance.
#skip-name-resolve

## If open-files-limit is set very low, MySQL may increase on its own. Either
## way, increase this if MySQL gives 'too many open files' errors. Setting
## this above 65535 could be unwise (MySQL may crash).
open-files-limit                = 20000

### Cache
thread-cache-size               = 16
table-open-cache                = 4096
table-definition-cache          = 512

## Generally, it is unwise to set the query cache to be larger than 64-128M 
## as the costs associated with maintaining the cache outweigh the performance
## gains. A far superior solution would be to implement memcached, though this
## required modifying the application, among other things.
query-cache-type                = 1
query-cache-size                = 32M
query-cache-limit               = 1M

### Per-thread Buffers
sort-buffer-size                = 1M
read-buffer-size                = 1M
read-rnd-buffer-size            = 2M
join-buffer-size                = 1M

### Temp Tables
tmp-table-size                  = 64M 
max-heap-table-size             = 64M

### Networking
back-log                        = 100
max-connections                 = 50
max-connect-errors              = 10000
max-allowed-packet              = 16M
interactive-timeout             = 600
wait-timeout                    = 180
net_read_timeout        = 30
net_write_timeout       = 30
# This value is the size of the listen queue for incoming TCP/IP connections.
back_log            = 128

#### Storage Engines
## Set this to force MySQL to use a particular engine / table-type
## for new tables. This setting can still be overridden by specifying
## the engine explicitly in the CREATE TABLE statement.
default-storage-engine         = InnoDB

## Makes sure MySQL does not start if InnoDB fails to start. This helps
## prevent ugly silent failures.
innodb                          = FORCE

### MyISAM
## Not sure what to set this to?
## Try running a 'du -sch /var/lib/mysql/*/*.MYI'
## This will give you a good estimate on the size of all the MyISAM indexes.
## (The buffer may not need to set that high, however)
key-buffer-size                 = 2M
## This setting controls the size of the buffer that is allocated when 
## sorting MyISAM indexes during a REPAIR TABLE or when creating indexes 
## with CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE.
myisam-sort-buffer-size         = 2M

### InnoDB
## Note: While most settings in MySQL can be set at run-time, many InnoDB
## variables cannot be set at runtime as require restarting MySQL
###
## These settings control how much RAM InnoDB will use. Generally, when using
## mostly InnoDB tables, the innodb-buffer-pool-size should be as large as
## is possible without swapping or starving other processes of RAM. The other 
## two settings usually do not need to be changed, but can help for very large 
## datasets.
innodb-buffer-pool-size         = 285M
innodb-log-buffer-size          = 8M

## Be careful when changing these as they require re-generating the 
## ib-logfile* files, which must be done carefully. Do not change this unless 
## you are familiar with the procedure.
innodb-log-file-size           = 128M
innodb-log-files-in-group      = 2

## This will cause each table to create its own .ibd file
innodb-file-per-table           = 1

## Setting this to 2 will decrease disk I/O but can cause up to a second of
## queries to be lost during a hard outage (i.e. power failures)
# innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit = 2

### Replication
## Set this to the Server's instance ID in replication environments
server-id                       = 1

#log-bin                        = /var/lib/mysql/bin-log
#relay-log                      = /var/lib/mysql/relay-log
#relay-log-space-limit          = 4G
#expire-logs-days               = 5

## This should be enabled on conventional MySQL slaves
#read-only                      = 1

## This will cause replicated statements on a slave to be written to the slave's binlog
## Enable this on the middle slave of M->S->S configs
#log-slave-updates              = 1

#binlog-format                  = STATEMENT

### Logging
## This option determines the destination for general query log and slow query log output.
## The option value can be given as one or more of the words TABLE, FILE, or NONE.
## NOTE: Table logging takes away 50% of performance and thus is not recommended
##       http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=30414
## In addition, you cannot backup the contents of these tables properly
## (mysqldump skips these tables by default since they cannot be locked)
#log-output                     = FILE
slow-query-log                 = 1
slow-query-log-file            = /var/lib/mysql/slow-log
long-query-time                = 2
log-queries-not-using-indexes  = 1

[mysqld-safe]
log-error                       = /var/log/mysqld.log

[mysqldump]
max-allowed-packet      = 16M

# * IMPORTANT: Additional settings that can override those from this file!
#   The files must end with '.cnf', otherwise they'll be ignored.
#
!includedir /etc/sysconfig/mysqld-config/
