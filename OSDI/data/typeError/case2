# -------------------------------------
# * Error description:
# (("typeError/case2","innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:500M"),"TypeError")

# Ennan's explanation: This path is wrong, because this is not a path type

# NO THIS IS NOT THE ERROR! (as correctly not identified by our tool!)
# see http://lists.mysql.com/mysql/116218 for correct error id & solution
# the real error was that the system could not see the path value for 'Server[WinMySQLadmin]'
# TODO - to support this error, we need to be able to look at the environment.

# we can support a modified version of the error, as listed in this file where it has been set to an int
