\label{sec-learn}

\ennan{This section details how do we extract rules from the
intermediate representations. This section may should have the following
two subsections: Aaron's part (including Xinyu's fine-grained
value correlation rule learning) and Jonathon's part.
In addition, we may need to add one more subsection about
learning system environment information related rules,
\eg, for paths and users.}
