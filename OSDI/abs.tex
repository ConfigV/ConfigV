\section*{Abstract}

System failures resulting from configuration errors 
have become the major factors affecting the availability and
reliability of today's software systems.
While many misconfiguration handling techniques,
\eg, misconfiguration checking and troubleshooting, have been proposed, 
offering automatic verification to configuration files -- like
what we did to regular programs -- is still an open problem.
The main reason is software configuration files are poorly structured 
and typed, thus obstructing any possible language-based verification. 
This paper presents, \app, the first automatic verification framework for
software configurations.
In order to verify a configuration file,
\app first analyzes a given dataset sample of configuration files, 
and then derives rules for building a language model from 
the given configuration dataset. 
Finally, the resulting language model can be used
to verify new configuration files and detect errors in them.
At the heart of \app lies a novel learning engine, 
which employs a probabilistic type inference strategy and
defines an intermediate representation for the rule type.
Using this engine, \app learns various type rules (\eg, orderings,
value relations, type errors, and user defined rules)
to verify configuration files of interest.
\app framework is highly modular, 
does not rely on the system source code, and
can be applied to any new configuration file type with minimal user input.  
%Our tool, named \app, relies on an abstract representation of language 
%rules to allow for this modularity.
