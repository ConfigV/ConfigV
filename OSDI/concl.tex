\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce \app, a highly-modular framework 
that allows verification of configuration files, 
even without a language model of the file.
New verification properties require only a small amount of code 
and are not language specific, 
all indicating that \app could be widely adopted by system administrators.
Such a verification tool that scales in both performance and expressivity 
can revolutionize configuration file checking, 
reducing the cost of system maintenance and failure dramatically.
