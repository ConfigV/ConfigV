It is worth noting that our false positive rate is a conservative guess.
Since these benchmarks are taken from online forums, there is no garuntee they are correct, even after fixing the error the user posted a question about.
Indeed, while running these benchmarks, \app detected some files that had errors from other benchmark files, in addition the error we expected.
We fail benchmark 18 because we do not yet support relations between file sizes of different units (Mb to Kb)
