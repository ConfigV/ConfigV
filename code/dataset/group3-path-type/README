This is a category of misconfiguration, called variable type error.

- In the error file, general_log (line 74 in error) is assigned: 
  /var/log/mysql/mysql.log. This is wrong, since general_log should be 
  assigned an integer type value, and there is another general_log_file 
  whose value should be /var/log/mysql/mysql.log

- In other words, the error file misses entry named general_log_file, and
  assigns a string type value to a (integer type) variable.  

- In correct1, this is very clear. The file has both entries and the types
  are correct.

- In correct2, users did not put general_log_file or general_log, which is
  also OK. 

- The key thing here is, general_log_file and general_log must appear 
  at the same time. general_log_file should be path (str), and 
  general_log should be an integer.
