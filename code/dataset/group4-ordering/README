This misconfiguration is called ordering error. Note that this is Apache
server PHP4 version. It seems PHP5 has different format.

- In the error file, recode.so is behind mysql.so. This is wrong because
  recode.so has to be defined before mysql.

- In the two correct files, mysql.so is behind recode.so.

Another evidence is Fig.1 in our draft.  


* error: extension=recode.so should not be after extension=mysql.so

          datadir=c:/wamp/bin/mysql/mysql5.1.30/data

* error3: innodb_strict_mode should not be after innodb_file_format_check
