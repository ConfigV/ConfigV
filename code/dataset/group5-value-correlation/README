This is a value correlation misconfiguration problem.

All the variables underlying [wampmysqld] are responsible for MySQL server
setting initialization.

In the error file, key_buffer is assigned to be 16M; however, 
max_allowed_packet is assigned 100M. This is why the file is incorrect.
You cannot put max_allowed_packet larger than key_buffer.
In the runtime, this would make your MySQL server get crashed.

changed the error to setting table to 64000. it conflict with a port number. clearly not an actual error, but at least it shows the cencept works.
16M isnt a int type, so we would need a specialized few functions to deal with that type.
qtypes will resolve this problem if i have time to work out compositionality

Please see the two correct files, max_allowed_packet is lower than
the key_buffer.

* This is a real misconfiguration problem in practice. The evidence is

* error: max_allowed_packet should be smaller than key_buffer

* error2: max_allowed_packet should be smaller than key_buffer

* error3: max_connections should be smaller than connection_buffer

* error4: max_allowed_packet = 100M higher than key_buffer

* error5: key_buffer (line 60) is smaller than sort_buffer_size  --DONT SUPPORT COMPARISON OVER MB and KB (yet)
