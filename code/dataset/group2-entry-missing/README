This is an ``entry missing'' misconfiguration problem.

In error file, [mysqld] did not give a socket path to mysql server. 


This is a category of misconfiguration, called entry missing.

- In the error file, [mysqld] (line 35 in error) did not explicitly assign
  a socket path to mysql server. This would make MySQL get crashed during
  runtime.

- In correct1 and correct2, it is clear that the socket paths have been
  explicitly assigned to [mysqld].

- The key thing here is: [mysqld] must be assigned socket path explicitly;
  otherwise, the server would crash in runtime.
