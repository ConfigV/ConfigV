We verify configuration files.
While previous attempts to learn a model for these highly unstructured files have focused on machine learning, we instead take a probabilistic logic approach.
Probabilistic logic allows us to provide justification for our learning results, giving proof of the verification task.
Because the resulting model has a clear logical structure, as opposed traditional machine learning techniques such as neural nets, we can do further analysis on the model that improves our results.
