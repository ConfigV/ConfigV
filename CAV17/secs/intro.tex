\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}


Our main contributions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Using a probabilistic logical inference approach to the learning task, which builds a more informative structure than state of the art machine learning algorithms
 
\item A basic application of graph analysis on the learned model to improve results in a way not available to traditional machine learning approaches 

\item An open-source implementation, \app, of this approach applied to a set of 256 real world benchmarks. \app identify XX new misconfigurations errors on YY of these files.
\end{enumerate}
