\section{Learner}
\label{sec-learn}


The goal of the learner module is to derive rules and constraints from
the intermediate representation generated by the translator.
In general, the learner module has two components.
The first component ($\S$\ref{subsec-rules}) 
learns rules for checking configuration errors like
missing entry errors, ordering errors, and fine-grained value correlation errors. 
These errors tend to cause total system failures, but can also be more insidious and slow down the system only when the load increase beyond a certain threshold.

Note that in \app, probabilistic typing is implemented as a learning module than can be easily extended to support more types.
