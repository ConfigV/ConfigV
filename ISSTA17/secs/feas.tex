The language of TravisCI configuration files can likely be handled by ConfigC.
ConfigC works on languages with shallow parse trees, and most of the .travis.yml files are shallow.
However, in this case we may be able to learn the common errors by using the API and the temporal data from the commits.

We might code an error as the diff between a sequential pair of an erroring commit and a passing commit.
As a new direction, we may also explore how useful this data is for learning/verification directly.
My guess is that is data will be too noisy, but either way, it should give us a sense of the problem.

To build such a database, scrape the .travis.yml files from each commit for a set of repos.
This can be achieved with the \verb|tr_status, git_commit and gh_project_name| fields from the API.
